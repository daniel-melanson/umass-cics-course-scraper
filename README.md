Information pertaining to UMass CICS courses is spread out. UMass Spire has a total list of courses, but some of those courses have not been scheduled in decades. The CICS website has a list of courses, but enrollment information is not always present or reliable. This program will scrapes various UMass websites for CICS related (COMPSCI, CICS, INFORMATICS, MATH, STATISTIC) course information. In addition, it will retrieve information about staff at UMass CICS and how to contact them. Information is then uploaded to a mongo database.

If a UMass administrator would like me to take this down, then you can contact my student email.
